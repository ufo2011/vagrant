# VMware

Because of how VMware handles disk management, a Vagrant guest _must_ be powered
off for any changes to be applied to a guest. If you make a configuration change
with a guests disk, you will need to `vagrant reload` the guest for any changes
to be applied.

For more information on how to use VMware to configure disks for a guest, refer
to the [general usage](/vagrant/docs/disks/usage) and [configuration](/vagrant/docs/disks/configuration)
guide for more information.

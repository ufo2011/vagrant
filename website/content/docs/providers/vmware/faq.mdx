# Frequently Asked Questions

## Q: How do I use the VMware Fusion Tech Preview?

The Vagrant VMware utility expects VMware Fusion to be installed in a specific
path on macOS. Since the VMware Fusion Tech Preview installs into a different
path, the Vagrant VMware utility will fail to detect the installation and will
not start. To resolve this you can create a symlink from the VMware Fusion
Tech Preview installation path to the normal VMware Fusion installation path:

```shell-session
sudo ln -s /Applications/VMware\ Fusion\ Tech\ Preview.app /Applications/VMware\ Fusion.app
```


## Q: How do I upgrade my currently installed Vagrant VMware plugin?

You can update the Vagrant VMware plugin to the latest version by re-running the
install command:

```shell-session
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vmware-desktop
```

To upgrade the Vagrant VMware utility, download the latest version from the
[Vagrant VMware utility downloads page](/vagrant/downloads/vmware) and install the
system package to your local system.

## Q: Do I need a license for the Vagrant VMware plugin?

No, the Vagrant VMware plugin has been open sourced under the MPL. A license
is no longer required for using the Vagrant VMware plugin. If the plugin you
are using still requires a license, simply upgrade your plugin:

```
$ vagrant plugin update vagrant-vmware-desktop
```
